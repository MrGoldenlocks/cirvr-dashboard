Submitted are the source files where the code was written, the rest of the files are the dependencies
and environment for React/Node.js

Removed from the project is the environment component that contained database information that I did not want to make public. 

To look at the main code navigate to the path "src/components".

In order to run the dashboard application after obtaining all files, you should first download Node.js at:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Afterwards, go into a command prompt and navigate within the 'dashboad' directory.
Once there you should run the following commands:
npm install
npm start

"npm install" will download all of the dependencies needed for the React application,
the following application "npm start" will start the application through on a local server and run it in the browser (default at localhost:3000)
